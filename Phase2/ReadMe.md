# ðŸ“Š Phase 2: SIEM Dashboard Analysis

## ðŸ”§ SIEM Setup

In this phase, we integrated logs from both the **victim** and **attacker** environments into **Splunk**, our chosen SIEM tool. This step enables central analysis, threat detection, and deeper insight into attacker behavior.

### âœ… Logs Integrated: ("logs from both environments") 
- **Victim (Metasploitable3)**: Apache access logs (`access.log`)
- **Attacker (Kali Linux)**: System journal logs (`system-journal.log`)

### ðŸ“Š Log

Once both log files were uploaded, we used Splunk's **Search & Reporting** app to:

> ## ðŸ§  Attack Analysis & Pattern Detection

In this section, we deep-dive into Splunkâ€™s powerful analytics capabilities to uncover meaningful patterns that shed light on the attack behavior. Our focus was to:

- Identify **frequently accessed endpoints**
- Determine **malicious IP activity**
- Highlight trends in attacker interaction with the system

### ðŸ“Š Attack Pattern Visualization

To detect potential malicious behavior, we ran pattern analysis on the `access_combined` logs. Splunkâ€™s pattern detection grouped similar request patterns together, making it easier to visually spot suspicious actions.

**Findings:**
- The requests to `exploit.php` and `read_log.php` were repeatedly triggered, suggesting automation tools or scripts were involved.
- The pattern reveals constant interaction with chat logs (`/chat/read_log.php`), likely as part of a payload delivery or exfiltration mechanism.
- Consistent user-agents (`Node.js` and custom agents) hint at non-browser-based access, further confirming attack automation.

### ðŸ“Œ Most Accessed Client IPs

Next, we analyzed the **top client IPs** to determine who interacted with the server most frequently. This allows us to narrow down potential attacker IPs.

**Findings:**
- The IP `10.0.2.5` (our known **attacker machine**) had an extremely high volume of requests. This clearly links the attacker to the reverse shell activity and payload delivery.
- `127.0.0.1` appeared frequently as well â€” this is normal localhost activity from the victim system.
- Several corrupted or anomalous IP values appeared as hex/garbage characters â€” these could be malformed logs or intentionally obfuscated traffic, possibly worth deeper review.

---

### âœ… Summary of Insights

From the two analyses above, we confirmed:
- Consistent malicious interaction with vulnerable PHP endpoints.
- Automated tools used from the attacker's IP (`10.0.2.5`) with repeated exploit attempts.
- A recognizable **pattern of payload delivery and interaction**, which aligns with the reverse shell and attack phases from Phase 1.

Together, these visualizations serve as a forensic trace of the attack behavior in Phase 2, providing clear, time-aligned, and IP-based evidence of compromise.
